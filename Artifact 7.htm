<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is my reflection for my seventh artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The last artifact I chose for my first E-portfolio is the emoji task. For this assignment, we had to choose an emoji and professionally share our thoughts and ideas about the emoji. We also had to show the new skills we learned about video conferencing. For example, raising our hand to speak, giving feedback, listening to everyoneâ€™s ideas, feelings, and thoughts, sharing opinions, and much more. This skill that I learned during this unit in the course, would be helpful in the future when I start working. For instance, when I have a meeting with international clients, when I am not able to attend the meeting in person, and many other ways. The Catholic Graduate Expectation I relate to by this activity is being a self-directing, responsible, lifelong learner. Learning and adapting to new and different kinds of technology, such as video conferencing, is a great way to reflect a commitment to continuous personal and professional development. </P>
