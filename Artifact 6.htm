<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is my reflection for my sixth artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> This activity will improve my professionalism skills. For this task, I had to create a letter to one of the new employees and congratulate them. Instead of congratulating them as a friend, I showed professionalism and congratulated them as a senior. This relates to the CGEs by showing how I am a discerning believer formed in the Catholic faith community. Having professionalism skills includes ethical behavior, integrity, and respect for others. These are fundamental values in the Catholic faith community. According to my research, demonstrating professionalism reflects a commitment to living out Christian values in everyday interactions and decisions. </P>
