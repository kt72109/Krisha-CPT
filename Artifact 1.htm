<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is my reflection for my first artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The assignment I chose for my first artifact was the 'Personal Business Letter' we wrote on April 16 for our Google Doc Test. This activity was one of my best work. It represents my skills of writig a formal letter I learned in this business class. It would definetly benefit me in the future, in the business world because it strenghtens my skills of writing a formal letter. At any time I have to write a formal letter to a company, this skill will be beneficial for me. Writing a formal business letter isn't only related to the business world, but is also connected to the Catholic Graduate Expectations (CGE) and Social Teachings. It helps in being an effective communicator, reflective,creative, and holister thinker. It also involves discussing rights and responsibilities. <P>
