<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is my reflection for my fifth artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> This presentation shows my understanding of the plagiarism policy at my school, my top two universities, and the plagiarism policy at the workplace. I have learned many things while researching for this assignment. It helped me be aware of the consequences of plagiarism in schools, universities, and even workplaces. This will be beneficial to me in the future academically and professionally. Understanding the plagiarism policies makes me a collaborative contributor. According to my research, properly citing and crediting others' work shows respect and fairness in collaborative efforts. Acknowledging and giving credit to each member of the group, creates a spirit of collaboration, teamwork, and mutual respect. </P>
