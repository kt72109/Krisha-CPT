<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is my reflection for my third artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> This activity shows my organizational skills. I have put my information and products in an organized, clear, and eye-catching manner. This was one of my best works in the BTT101 course. In the future, when I want to start my business or help enhance my companyâ€™s website, I can use the skills I learned in this class to make the website more appealing and eye-catching for the viewers and my/our clients. This skill is connected to CGE in many ways. For instance, it makes me a responsible citizen. These skills enable me to participate actively and responsibly in the community by managing my time and resources wisely. </P>
