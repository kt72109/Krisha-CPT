<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is my reflection for my second artifact: </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> The second artifact I used was the letter I wrote to my fellow employees at Sephora as an official organizer at Sephora. It allowed me to understand how it differs from writing a letter to the CEO and writing a letter to employees/ co-workers. In the future, it will be helpful for me in the future when I have to send emails or letters for work purposes. This teaches me how to respect others. It is one of the Catholic Graduate Expectations and Social Teachings. By learning the appropriate level of formality in writing, graduates can engage more constructively and inclusively with others. </P>
